Useful AIO script for installing and launching various security and pentesting apps
**Designed for Kali. I plan on updating the software to supporting bare Ubuntu

To install just git clone or download zip. 
-chmod +x Hydrogen.sh
-./Hydrogen.sh
**Do not run as root. Proton and tor will fail. Insert password as required instead

When run for the first time, you can installing or "bypass" ONLY if you change directory from default (/home/user)

Thank you and enjoy (:
