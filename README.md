Useful AIO script for installing and launching various security and pentesting apps
**Designed for Kali. I plan on updating the software to supporting bare Ubuntu

To install just git clone or download zip. 
-chmod +x Hydrogen.sh
-./Hydrogen.sh
**Do not run as root. Proton and tor will fail. Insert password as required instead

When run for the first time, you can installing or "bypass" ONLY if you change directory from default (/home/user)

Seems simple to me but I coded it so maybe not haha. I had fun coding this and any replies on improving would be appreciated. Repairs, additions, removal, etc.
I have about 2 days experience in Bash scripts so far

V2.0 Beta include metadata remover, better design for public use, and first bugs removed (features fail)

Thank you and enjoy (:
